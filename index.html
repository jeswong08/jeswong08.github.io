        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current student at University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in psychology with a minor in law and society. Main area of focus is gender studies and race discrimination who aims to become a lawyer to help give back to those who have been misrepresented. I have seen first hand how people are treated simply based on the color of their skin, gender, or preferred sexual orientation. I want to be the change / voice for those who feel like they don’t have a voice to speak about the mistreatment of not only themselves, but the millions of people around the world who face these same problems. 
<br><br>

        As a gender and race discrimination lawyer, I want to specialize in advocating for individuals who have faced discrimination based on their gender. With an understanding of both federal and state laws, as well as my unwavering commitment to justice, I want to play a crucial role in challenging inequality and promoting gender equality in various areas of life. My love for this job is found in the dedication I have to protect the rights of my clients and ensure they are treated fairly. I want to work in various aspects ranging from unequal pay and job to harassment and hostile work environments. I want to be skilled in being equipped to navigate these complex issues by providing legal guidance and representation to those who have been unfairly treated. One of my primary responsibilities as a gender discrimination lawyer is to assess the validity of discrimination claims.  I will be doing this by conducting thorough investigations, gathering evidence, and analyzing relevant status and case law to build a compelling case. By ensuring careful examination of the circumstances surrounding each incident of the alleged discrimination, I can determine the most effective course of action to ensure justice on behalf of my client. I strive to resolve disputes through negotiation and mediation, in which I seek amicable solutions that addresses my clients’ grievance while avoiding the need for a high cost litigation. I will always advocate for my clients’ rights in court and present a persuasive argument and advocate for fair and just outcomes. 

e<br><br>

        Beyond just simply representing individual clients, as a gender discrimination lawyer, I also understand that I play a vital role in shaping the border aspect of social and legal discourse that surrounds race and gender equality. I hope that my work in advocacy will contribute to the development of progressive legal precedents and policies aiming to eradicate gender and race based discrimination in all its forms. By raising awareness of the systemic inequalities and providing the proactive measures to address them, as their lawyer, I will help foster a more inclusive and equitable society for all future generations. I want to engage in community outreach and education initiatives. By helping to participate, lead, and teach workshops, seminars, and other informational resources, I hope to empower individuals to recognize and challenge discrimination they see in their own lives as well as in the workspace. To conclude, I want to strive to foster a culture of respect, equality, and dignity for all people of different races and gender.
